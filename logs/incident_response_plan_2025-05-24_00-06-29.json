Write a detailed incident response plan for a [Ransomware] attack. \nTailor it for a [Security Analyst] and ensure it aligns with [NIST SP 800-61] guidelines. \nUse bullet points and include communication steps.\n",
    "response": "You are a cybersecurity expert. Write a detailed incident response plan for a Ransomware attack. Tailor it for a Security Analyst and ensure it aligns with NIST SP 800-61 guidelines. Use bullet points and include communication steps.\n\n# Incident Response Plan: Ransomware Attack\n\n## Audience Role: Security Analyst\n## Compliance Target: NIST SP 800-61\n\n### Step 1: Detection and Identification\n- **Initial Assessment:**\n  - Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns.\n  - Look for file encryption alerts or ransom notes on affected systems.\n- **Confirm Ransomware:**\n  - Analyze ransom note contents and file extensions for confirmation.\n\n### Step 2: Containment\n- **Isolate Infected Systems:**\n  - Disconnect affected devices from the network to prevent further spread.\n  - Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to contain the infection.\n- **Identify Patient Zero:**\n  - Determine the initial entry point of the ransomware for remediation.\n\n### Step 3: Eradication\n- **Remove Ransomware:**\n  - Use antivirus software to scan and remove the ransomware from affected systems.\n  - Restore files from backups once systems are clean.\n- **Patch Vulnerabilities:**\n  - Identify and patch the vulnerabilities that allowed the ransomware to infiltrate.\n\n### Step 4: Recovery\n- **Restore Data:**\n  - Reimage or rebuild infected systems from clean backups.\n  - Verify data integrity before restoring it to production.\n- **Monitor Systems:**\n  - Continuously monitor systems for any signs of re-infection.\n\n### Step 5: Communication\n- **Internal Communication:**\n  - Notify the incident response team, IT department, and management about the ransomware attack.\n  - Provide regular updates on the incident response progress.\n- **External Communication:**\n  - Notify relevant authorities as per regulatory requirements.\n  - Inform affected parties, customers, and vendors about the incident and steps taken.\n\n### Step 6: Post-Incident Analysis\n- **Lessons Learned:**\n  - Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify gaps in security controls.\n  - Document lessons learned and update incident response procedures accordingly.\n- **Training and Awareness:**\n  - Provide training to staff on ransomware prevention and response best practices.\n\nBy following this incident response plan tailored for a Security Analyst and aligned with NIST SP 800-61 guidelines, you can effectively respond to a Ransomware attack and mitigate its impact on the organization."
