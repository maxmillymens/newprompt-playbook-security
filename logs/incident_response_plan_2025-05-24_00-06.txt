You are a cybersecurity expert. Write a detailed incident response plan for a Ransomware attack. Tailor it for a Security Analyst and ensure it aligns with NIST SP 800-61 guidelines. Use bullet points and include communication steps.

# Incident Response Plan: Ransomware Attack

## Audience Role: Security Analyst
## Compliance Target: NIST SP 800-61

### Step 1: Detection and Identification
- **Initial Assessment:**
  - Monitor network traffic for unusual patterns.
  - Look for file encryption alerts or ransom notes on affected systems.
- **Confirm Ransomware:**
  - Analyze ransom note contents and file extensions for confirmation.

### Step 2: Containment
- **Isolate Infected Systems:**
  - Disconnect affected devices from the network to prevent further spread.
  - Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to contain the infection.
- **Identify Patient Zero:**
  - Determine the initial entry point of the ransomware for remediation.

### Step 3: Eradication
- **Remove Ransomware:**
  - Use antivirus software to scan and remove the ransomware from affected systems.
  - Restore files from backups once systems are clean.
- **Patch Vulnerabilities:**
  - Identify and patch the vulnerabilities that allowed the ransomware to infiltrate.

### Step 4: Recovery
- **Restore Data:**
  - Reimage or rebuild infected systems from clean backups.
  - Verify data integrity before restoring it to production.
- **Monitor Systems:**
  - Continuously monitor systems for any signs of re-infection.

### Step 5: Communication
- **Internal Communication:**
  - Notify the incident response team, IT department, and management about the ransomware attack.
  - Provide regular updates on the incident response progress.
- **External Communication:**
  - Notify relevant authorities as per regulatory requirements.
  - Inform affected parties, customers, and vendors about the incident and steps taken.

### Step 6: Post-Incident Analysis
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Conduct a post-incident analysis to identify gaps in security controls.
  - Document lessons learned and update incident response procedures accordingly.
- **Training and Awareness:**
  - Provide training to staff on ransomware prevention and response best practices.

By following this incident response plan tailored for a Security Analyst and aligned with NIST SP 800-61 guidelines, you can effectively respond to a Ransomware attack and mitigate its impact on the organization.
